\arguments{
\item{f}{Either a pre-calculated object of class \code{\link{bivden}}
representing the `case' (numerator) density estimate, or an object of class
\code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} giving the observed case data. Alternatively, if
\code{f} is \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} object with dichotomous
factor-valued \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{marks}}, the function treats the first
level as the case data, and the second as the control data, obviating the
need to supply \code{g}.}

\item{g}{As for \code{f}, for the `control' (denominator) density; this
object must be of the same class as \code{f}. Ignored if, as stated above,
\code{f} contains both case and control observations.}

\item{log}{Logical value indicating whether to return the (natural)
log-transformed relative risk function as recommended by Kelsall and Diggle
(1995a). Defaults to \code{TRUE}, with the alternative being the raw density
ratio.}

\item{h0}{A single positive numeric value or a vector of length 2 giving the
global bandwidth(s) to be used for case/control density estimates;
defaulting to a common oversmoothing bandwidth computed via \code{\link{OS}}
on the pooled data using \code{nstar = "geometric"} if unsupplied. Ignored if \code{f} and \code{g} are
already \code{\link{bivden}} objects.}

\item{hp}{A single numeric value or a vector of length 2 giving the pilot
bandwidth(s) to be used for fixed-bandwidth estimation of the pilot
densities for adaptive risk surfaces. Ignored if \code{adapt = FALSE} or if
\code{f} and \code{g} are already \code{\link{bivden}} objects.}

\item{adapt}{A logical value indicating whether to employ adaptive smoothing
for internally estimating the densities. Ignored if \code{f} and \code{g}
are already \code{\link{bivden}} objects.}

\item{shrink}{A logical value indicating whether to compute the shrinkage estimator
of Hazelton (2023). This is only possible for \code{adapt=FALSE}.}

\item{shrink.args}{A named list of optional arguments controlling the shrinkage estimator.
Possible entries are \code{rescale} (a logical value indicating whether to integrate
to one with respect to the control distribution over the window); \code{type} 
(a character string stipulating the shrinkage methodology to be used, either the
default \code{"lasso"} or the alternative \code{"Bithell"}); and \code{lambda}
(a non-negative numeric value determining the degree of shrinkage towards uniform
relative risk---when set to its default \code{NA}, it is selected via cross-validation).}

\item{tolerate}{A logical value indicating whether to internally calculate a
corresponding asymptotic p-value surface (for tolerance contours) for the
estimated relative risk function. See `Details'.}

\item{doplot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, an image plot of the estimated
relative risk function is produced using various visual presets. If
additionally \code{tolerate} was \code{TRUE}, asymptotic tolerance contours
are automatically added to the plot at a significance level of 0.05 for
elevated risk (for more flexible options for calculating and plotting
tolerance contours, see \code{\link{tolerance}} and
\code{\link{tol.contour}}).}

\item{pilot.symmetry}{A character string used to control the type of
symmetry, if any, to use for the bandwidth factors when computing an
adaptive relative risk surface. See `Details'. Ignored if \code{adapt =
FALSE}.}

\item{epsilon}{A single non-negative numeric value used for optional scaling
to produce additive constant to each density in the raw ratio (see
`Details'). A zero value requests no additive constant (default).}

\item{verbose}{Logical value indicating whether to print function progress
during execution.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to any internal calls of
\code{\link{bivariate.density}} for estimation of the requisite densities.
Ignored if \code{f} and \code{g} are already \code{\link{bivden}} objects.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"rrs"}. This is a named list with the
following components:
\item{rr}{A pixel \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{im}}age of the
  estimated risk surface.}
\item{f}{An object of class \code{\link{bivden}}
  used as the numerator or `case' density estimate.}
\item{g}{An object of
  class \code{\link{bivden}} used as the denominator or `control' density
  estimate.}

  \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{im}}age of the \emph{p}-value surface for tolerance
  contours; \code{NULL} otherwise.}

\description{
Estimates a \emph{relative risk} function based on the ratio of two 2D
kernel density estimates.
}
\details{
The relative risk function is defined here as the ratio of the `case'
density to the `control' (Bithell, 1990; 1991). Using kernel density
estimation to model these densities (Diggle, 1985), we obtain a workable
estimate thereof. This function defines the risk function \emph{r} in the
following fashion: \cr\cr \emph{r}\code{ = (fd + epsilon*max(gd))/(gd +
epsilon*max(gd))}, \cr\cr where \code{fd} and \code{gd} denote the case and
control density estimates respectively. Note the (optional) additive
constants defined by \code{epsilon} times the maximum of each of the
densities in the numerator and denominator respectively (see Bowman and
Azzalini, 1997). A more recent shrinkage estimator developed by Hazelton (2023)
is also implemented.

The log-risk function \emph{rho}, given by \emph{rho} = log[\emph{r}], is
argued to be preferable in practice as it imparts a sense of symmetry in the
way the case and control densities are treated (Kelsall and Diggle,
1995a;b). The option of log-transforming the returned risk function is
therefore selected by default.

When computing adaptive relative risk functions, the user has the option of
obtaining a so-called \emph{symmetric} estimate (Davies et al. 2016) via
\code{pilot.symmetry}. This amounts to choosing the same pilot density for
both case and control densities. By choosing \code{"none"} (default), the
result uses the case and control data separately for the fixed-bandwidth
pilots, providing the original asymmetric density-ratio of Davies and
Hazelton (2010). By selecting either of \code{"f"}, \code{"g"}, or
\code{"pooled"}, the pilot density is calculated based on the case, control,
or pooled case/control data respectively (using \code{hp[1]} as the fixed
bandwidth). Davies et al. (2016) noted some beneficial practical behaviour
of the symmetric adaptive surface over the asymmetric.

If the user selects \code{tolerate = TRUE}, the function internally computes
asymptotic tolerance contours as per Hazelton and Davies (2009) and Davies
and Hazelton (2010). When \code{adapt = FALSE}, the reference density
estimate (argument \code{ref.density} in \code{\link{tolerance}}) is taken
to be the estimated control density. The returned pixel
\code{\link[spatstat.geom]{im}}age of \emph{p}-values (see `Value') is
interpreted as an upper-tailed test i.e. smaller \emph{p}-values represent
greater evidence in favour of significantly increased risk. For greater
control over calculation of tolerance contours, use \code{\link{tolerance}}.
