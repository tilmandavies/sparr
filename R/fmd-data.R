#' Veterinary foot-and-mouth disease outbreak data
#' 
#' Data of the spatial locations and time of farms infected by veterinary foot-and-mouth disease
#' in the county of Cumbria, UK, over a course of nearly 250 days between February and August in 2001.
#' There are 410 infected farms (the cases), and 1866 uninfected farms (the controls). The data
#' have been jittered and randomly thinned by an unspecified amount to preserve anonymity. 
#'  
#' @name fmd
#' @format \code{fmd} is a named list with two members:
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{$cases}}{
#' An object of class \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} giving the spatial locations of the 410 infected
#' farms within a polygonal study region representing the county of Cumbria. The \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{marks}}
#' component of this object contain the integer day of infection (from beginning of study period).
#' }
#' 
#' \item{\code{$controls}}{
#' An object of class \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} defined over the same spatial study region with the locations
#' of the 1866 uninfected farms.
